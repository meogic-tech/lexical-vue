# What is Lexical?

Lexical is an extensible JavaScript web text-editor framework with an emphasis on reliability, accessibility and performance. Lexical aims to provide a best-in-class developer experience, so you can easily prototype and build features with confidence. Combined with a highly extensible architecture, Lexical allows developers to create unique text editing experiences that scale in size and functionality.

This package is a collection of plugins and composables for Vue 3 applications. It is based on [@lexical/react](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/tree/main/packages/lexical-react).
All main concepts are inherited from the main package. Please also check the [Lexical docs](https://lexical.dev/docs/intro).
